I would implement a score manager. The score manager would track how many ducks the player has hit.
The score maanger benefits the game becasue is give the player a goal and a sense of how they are doing.
The score manager would track how many ducks the player has hit and increase by 1 for each duck hit.

I would implement a DLL that would mod the ducks.
The DLL would be implemted by creating it in c++ and then adding it to unity.
The DLL would mods the ducks by changing their size and speed making the game more fun for the player.
